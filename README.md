# master-examples-list

## Description
This repository is a collection of Java projects used as in-class examples for COMP303. My main objective for this is to create a centralized reference for assignments, labs, and projects. I think this way makes it easier to review and reuse code without switching between multiple repo's or IDE windows. 

## Motivation
I created this repository because I found it a bit tedious and inefficient to switch between multiple IDE windows or repositories to reference code.

## Usage
... currently deciding if this is needed
